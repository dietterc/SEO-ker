## Description and Objective

The goal of this project is to make a poker inspired party game, where players guess the google search frequency of certain words. More in depth rules for the game can be found [here](https://github.com/dietterc/SEO-ker/wiki/Rules). The application itself will be a web app, where players can create a private lobby and invite others to play with them. Intended for around 8-10 players max, this will be a fun game to play over discord or zoom with your friends. 

The technologies used can be found [here](https://github.com/dietterc/SEO-ker/wiki/Language-and-Technologies). This project is part of our COMP 4350 Software Engineering 2 course at University of Manitoba.
