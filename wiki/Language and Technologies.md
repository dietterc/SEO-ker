## Next.js
[Nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/)  
We will be using the Next.js JavaScript framework for the frontend and backend of our web application.

## MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)  
We will be using MongoDB as a database for our project. We chose this because we think that a document based database would suit our project better than a relational database because the main data we will be storing is user data such as scores, display names, matches played, etc.

## GitHub flow 

[GitHub flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)  
This is the model we will be using to maintain our GitHub repository.
