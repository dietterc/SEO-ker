## Next.js
[Nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/)  
Next.js is a react javascript framework that we will be using for the frontend of our web application.   
Next.js also has server side functionality, but it is TBD if we will use it as such.

## socket.io
[socket.io](https://socket.io/)  
We are looking into using socket.io for communication between the server and client side of our application. However, we have not made a final decision.

## MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)  
We will be using MongoDB as a database for our project. We chose this because we think that a document based database would suit our project better than a relational database because the main data we will be storing is user data such as scores, display names, matches played, etc.

## GitHub flow 

[GitHub flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
