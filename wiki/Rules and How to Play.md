# SEO-ker: Rules and How to Play
1. One player is designated as Dealer at random from all players.
2. Each player is dealt 3 cards.
- Each card has one word or phrase written on it that corresponds to a Google search.
- Each google search has a corresponding value that is invisible to the player, which represents the average monthly searches for that word or phrase.
3. The player to the left of the Dealer goes first by playing a card from their hand, along with placing a bet representing how strongly they feel their card will win.
- Each bet goes into the “Pot”. 
4. Each player does the same as in step 3, going in a clockwise order around the table. If a player thinks they have no cards that can win, they can “fold” a card, discarding it and sitting out for the rest of the round  
- Players have to bet at least as much as the previous player. See (2) in Additional Rules. 
5. Repeat step 4 until all players have either folded, or reached a bet which no one raises or calls. 
6. After all bets have been placed, the value of all cards in play are revealed to the players. 
7. The player with the highest value wins all of the chips in the Pot, and players with no remaining chips are eliminated from the game.
8. The player to the left of the Dealer is designated as the Dealer for the next round. 
9. Each player is dealt one new card so that each player in the game starts with 3 cards. Repeat steps 3-8 until one player is left with chips.  

Additional Rules
1. If a player bets all of their money in a turn, this is called “all in”. Each player must match this to remain in the round. 
2. If a player can not afford to match a bet, they must either go all in or fold. If they go all in, their bet goes into the main pot. If the remaining players match the bet and have chips remaining, they can place bets in a separate side pot. If the player who went all in wins, they win the chips in the main pot, and the side pot is split between the players who contributed to it.
